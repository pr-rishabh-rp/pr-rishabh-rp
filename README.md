- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shenanigunr.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, machine learning and making this world a better place for the next generation, or at least preserve it as it is.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code; C++ and Python are one of my first languages. I can do basic coding but I have little confidence in it, but my passion shines on like a crazy diamond.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can get my hands on because I have little experience in project area and it would be good to learn. I'll try to contribute to the project in any way feasible for me but do not expect anything miraculous as I am still very much a beginner and learning.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, I have a Linkedin acount whose link is: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhrp. Yeah thats about it, if you reach me on linkedin maybe we can continue our conversation elsewhere taking into condition what social media both the party uses (i.e. you and me)
- :) I hope you have a good day. :}
